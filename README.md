Midwest Region did not take part in sales throughout 2020. However, they had sales throughout 2021. Northeast on the other hand had sales only in Jan 2020, And also throughout 2022.

Southeast operated only in April, Aug and Sept 2020 but was in operation all through 2021. However, Southeast performed well in sept and april 2020 more than the other months in 2021.
West  is the only Region that operated all through 2020 and 2021 which is the overall best Sales performance among other Region. And with a closer look West region performed so well across both year. 
From the State Ranking NYC top the Chart. However, West Gear and Foot locker are both in NYC. 



## Conclusion
Dec 2020 Sales performance was extremely low to Dec 2021 due to two Reasons:
Only West Region operated that month among other Region. While all Region was in operation in Dec 2021.
Also Only two Sales methods (Outlet, Online) was in operation in Dec 2020. While Outlet, Online and In-Store was in operation in Dec 2021. 

The Least Sales Performance by Sales Method came from Amazon and Walmart despite being a big brand might be due to these reasons:
From the Sales Method ranking, Online came the least. However, Amazon and Walmart is an Online Store, while West Gear is an In-store whereby people can walk in, which means People might prefer a walk-into-reality rather than purchasing online.
The top selling products are Men's Street Footwear, Women's Apparel, and Men's Athletic Footwear, which together account for higher of sales.
In-store sales are the top earning sales method, with West Gate being a significant contributor to in-store sales volume.
